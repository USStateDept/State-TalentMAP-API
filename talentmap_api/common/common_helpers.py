        The filter class (a subclass of FilterSet) passed into this function has knowledge of all

        We can only validate in this method filters which are implicit (and therefore a true model level filter)
        as the declared filters perform their validation on-call, and may or may not actually filter at
        the object level; invalid values for declared filters either return a 400 when queried or have no effect.

        This method does not check if the supplied value for the filter is valid, as we need to allow users to
        PATCH old or outdated saved searches, it simply evaluates if the filters are supported on the model for
        that filter class.

    Args:

    '''

    '''
    The goal of this function is to provide the queryset as it exists on an
    endpoint's view, after filtering has been completed. Naively, we might
    attempt using a Q object and the filters dict to filter the queryset. This
    would work for most cases, with the exception of declared filters such as
    'q' or 'is_available'; any custom filters such as these would not be processable
    and in fact would throw an error.

    The solution to this, is to use the view's filter class. Essentially, we trick
    the filter class into thinking we have passed a valid request. The steps to
    accomplish this are the following:
        1. Turn the filters into a MultiValueDict - this is required later for
           the construction of our QueryDict, to prevent nested lists
        2. Create a QueryDict of the filters - we need this to support some function
           calls that are made internally which would error out on a normal dict
        3. Create a fake request object, and set the QueryDict as the query_params
        4. Get the subset filter class
        5. Instantiate the subset filter class using query_params and the faked request
        6. Get the queryset from the filter class
